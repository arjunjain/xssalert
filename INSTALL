Thanks for downloading XSSAlert.

To install it, make sure you have Python >= 2.6 and PyQt >= 4 installed. Then run this command from the command prompt:

    make  
    sudo make install 

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "XSSAlert" directory to Python's site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.7)
    /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.6)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)

then run this command from command prompt
    python xssalert
    or
    goto Appplications->Internet->XSSAlert

To Uninstall it

   sudo make uninstall
